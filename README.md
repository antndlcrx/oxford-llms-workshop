# Oxford Large Language Models for Social Science Workshop 🚀

Large Language Models (LLMs) are revolutionising social science research with their exceptional text comprehension capabilities, opening new avenues for innovation. However, LLMs can introduce social biases into the output, and the reliability of their outputs can vary. Safely and responsibly harnessing LLMs while fostering innovation requires specialised training—a challenging task given the rapid pace of LLM research, with new models and updates emerging weekly.

Oxford LLMs addresses these challenges by uniting machine learning scientists, leading researchers, and industry practitioners to offer comprehensive training to social scientists. Our goal is to bridge the gap between academia and industry, as well as between social sciences and computer science, with a focus on natural language processing. Our workshop equips participants with the latest skills and fosters a community that promotes innovation in social science research, ensuring the safe and responsible use of LLMs.

## Contents 

This collection brings together lecture slides, workshop materials, and practical guides from our past iterations of the "Oxford LLMs" summer school for social sciences. The content spans foundational concepts to advanced applications—from transformer architectures and model interpretability to fine-tuning techniques and LLM agent systems. Whether you’re exploring core NLP principles or specialized implementations like retrieval-augmented generation, these materials provide both theoretical grounding and hands-on guidance. All resources are openly available for researchers, practitioners, and students working with LLMs in their research!

## 2024

Building on the 2023 program, the materials in 2024 feature both the fundamentals of LLMs, applied tutorials, and recent advancements. Particularly, the program delves deep into foundational concepts in model architecture and evaluation. Subsequent lectures explore agent-based systems and advanced fine-tuning techniques. The practical components address specialized applications including retrieval-augmented generation for social science research, implementation of observability tools, and workflow development for LLM agents. Technical deep dives cover the Gemini architecture and practical considerations for self-hosting models, providing end-to-end perspectives on contemporary LLM applications. **Grigory Sapunov**, **Tatiana Shavrina**, and **Ilya Boytsov** developed the lecture materials, with seminar contributions from **Atita Arora**, **John Githuly**, **Christian Silva**, and **Ciera Fowler**. See the full list of materials below:
